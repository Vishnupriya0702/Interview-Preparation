If you are having 8+ years experience then focus on -
Performance Tuning Part & Design Aspects

If you are targeting Top Product based companies then 
Data Structures & Algorithm is also very important.
Arrays, LinkedList & Trees should be good enough.

Remember, don't just learn to prepare for interviews.
your objective should be to effectively work on projects.

So it's important to focus more on internals & this will be the best way to be interview ready also!
